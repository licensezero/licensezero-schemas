# Metadata Schema

License Zero adds metadata to software packages so that users can identify all License Zero packages within their projects using `licensezero` command-line interface.

The data appear in different places, depending on the packaging convention.  Many kinds of packages will include `licensezero.json` files.  Other kinds of packages include License Zero metadata in their native package metadata files, as in `Cargo.toml` for Rust crates.
